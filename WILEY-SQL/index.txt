INDEX :

show table status where name = 'index_demo';

why do we use engine while creating index????
what way indexes are stored ?? --> B-Trees

EXPLAIN Command - it gives what is the plan of the query engine to execute the query.

TABLE STATUS COLUMNS : 

--Non-unique -> if value = 0 means unique index and if value = 1 non-unique index.

COMPOSITE INDEXING :

--CREATE INDEX secondary_indx on myTable(data);
--CREATE INDEX composite_idx on myTable(id,data);

PARTIAL INDEXING :

--CREATE INDEX partial_idx on myTable(data(2)); ---> First two data index will be created that is the partial index will be created.
