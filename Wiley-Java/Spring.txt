-------------- SPRING (Version 5.0)----------------

NOTE: In spring 6.0 java 17 is needed.

-> Spring Framework is an open source application framework for the java platform.

-> It aims to make J2EE development easier.

-> Spring Framework is a semi structured framework which  means it provides basic structure and developers can customised it according to their need.

Why Spring Framework ? 

-> It is lightweight and minimally invasive development with plain old java objects (POJOs).

-> Provides loose coupling through dependency injection and interface orientation.

-> Declaravtive programming through aspects and common convention.

-> Boilerplate reduction through aspects and templates.

-> @lombok library -- getters & setters  

Working of Spring ::

-> Beans is an object that follow the dependency injection pattern.

-> Whenever object is created in spring it is called beans.

-> Dependencies are injected externally rather than programmaticaly.

-> Beans have information on the classes depenedent on them.

-> Beans define their own attributes within bean descriptor and also define the beans they depend on n the same descriptors.

-> The bean does not need to locate and instantiate these classes using service locators called JNDI.

NOTE : JNDI( Java Naming and Directory Interface)

-> In a spring application, objects are created, wired together and live within the spring container.
	
	1. Beans factories - 
	
		--It is an implementation of factory Design Pattern 
		(Responsible for creation and dispensing of beans).
		
		--Responsible for creation of many types of beans rather than a single type of bean.
		
		
	2. Application context - 
	
		--To take full advantage of spring framework
		
		--Common implementation of application contetx are :
			
			::ClassPathXmLApplicationContext
			::FileSystemApplicationContext
			::XmlWebApplicationContext
			
			
Bean And Its Configuration :

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
	xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
	xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-4.0.xsd">
</beans> 
       
	
NOTE : XML Files Provides data defination

-- Example 1 :: 

package com.beans;
public class Employee{
	private int empId;
	private String empName;
	private String empDept;
}

public class EmployeeApp{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		BeanFactory beanfactory = new XMLBeanFactory(new ClassPathResource("beans.xml");
		System.out.println("BeanFactory is instantiated !!");
		
	}
}

-- Example 2 ::

public class TestApplicationContext {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		ApplicationContext appContext = new ClassPathXMLApplicationContext(""beans.xml);
		System.out.println("ApplicationContext is instantiated !!");
		
		Employee e1 = (Employee)appContext.getBean("emp1");
		e1.displayEmployee();
		
		Employee e2 = (Employee)appContext.getBean("emp2");
		e1.displayEmployee();
	}
}

emp.xml {

	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
	xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
	xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-4.0.xsd">
	
	<bean id="emp1" class="com.beans.Employee">
		<property name = "empId" value="102"/>
		<!-- push the value of empid to setEmpID (Setter Injection) -->
		
		<property name = "empName" values="Alan"/>
		<!-- push the value of empName to setEmpName (Setter Injection)-->
		
		<property name = "empDept" value ="Technology"/>
		<!-- push the value of empDept to setEmpDept (Setter Injection) -->
	</bean>
	
	<bean id="emp2" class="com.beans.Employee">
		<property name = "empID" value="103"/>
		<property name = "empName" values="King"/>
		<property name = "empDept" value ="Technology"/>
	</bean>
	
</beans>
}

BeanFactory Vs ApplicationContext ::

-- BeanFactory is lazy loaded (when required then loaded)

-- ApplicationContext is eagerly loaded (automatically loaded)

-- One descriptor file can be added in configuration with beanfactory.

-- Multiple descriptor File can be added in configuration when using application context.

-- Hence, applicationContext is much used by developers.


Types Of Dependencies Injection :

NOTE : DI and IOC go hand in hand 

-- Setter Injections :: The injection is done via a setter method. IOC uses setter methods to get the dependent classes it needs.

-- Getter Injections :: The injection is done via a getter method.

-- Constructor Injections :: 

	->IOC implementing class defining a constructor to get all its dependents.
	
	->Constructor injections can cause certain ambiguity.
	
	->To overcome ambiguity two helper utility are used "type" And "index".

NOTE :: What happens when ids are duplicated at multiple location??

--> The values will be overriden at the runtime,the last files values will be printed.

--> Suppose we have three descriptor files emp.xml , emp2.xml , emp3.xml and all contains id emp1 with different sets of input. Then the values that will be printed is from emp3.xml files that is the last file added.


-- Example 3 --

Make customer class -> int cusId,String custName,Address custAddress
Make Address class -> String buildingName ,String AreaName, String CityName

Scopes of The Beans ::

--To create multiple beans with different values but same id scopes are used.

-- Default Scope is singleton.

-- Prototype : Multiple beans are created based on the references.

-- Request : objects are created per request.

-- Session : Objects are created per session.

<bean id="car" class="com.beans.Car" scope="prototype">
.......
</bean>

-- Example 4 --

Make car class -> int chasisno , String make , String color

Life Cycle Of Bean :: 

	--BeanNameAware Interfaces : setBeanName()
	
	--BeanFactoryAware Interfaces : setBeanFactory()
	
	--BeanPostProcessor : Doesn't have any abstract methods.
	
	--InitialisingBean Interface : afterPropertiesSet()
	
	--Disposable Interface : destroy()
	
	
BeanNameAware (setBeanName) -> BeanFactoryAware (setBeanFactory) -> BeanPostProcessor(postProcessBeforeInitializing()) ->
InitializingBean(afterPropertiesSet) -> custom init() method -> BeanPostProcessor(postProcessAfterInitializing()) -> Bean is ready -> bean closed(registerShutdownHook()) -> bean destroyed.

AutoWiring ::

	-Its a feature of spring that enables you to inject the dependency of an object implicitly using either setter injection or constructor injection.
	
	-It requires the less code because we dont need to write the code to inject the dependency explicitly.
	
	-Though autowiring is useful the programmer has no control over it.
	
	- Types of autowiring :- 
		a) no 
		
		b) byName - when bean id name is same as property name then it can work.
		
		c) byType
		
		d) constructor
		
		f) autodetect - it is deprecated since spring 3.
